                EcoMetrics was created as a project of a Queen‚Äôs University Engineering course. ELEC290 encompasses team-based design to solve complex open-ended problems.

EcoMetrics was designed to solve the issue of dangerous camping conditions in the outdoors. By measuring temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide content, volatile organic compounds, and even sound, this product provides fast and accurate measurements for the user.

This project‚Äôs final product goal is to create a functioning device that can receive environmental input from multiple sensors connected to an Arduino microcontroller and relay the information to a front-end display.
